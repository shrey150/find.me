# Find.me
Find.me is a Phonegap app that uses Firebase to store users' locations and display them using Google Maps API. It lets you see other peoples' locations in real-time, updating every 5 seconds. Find.me is useful to just know your friends' and family members' locations without bothering them. The app also has a scouting feature, which is perfect for fun events such as scavenger hunts and similar things. We hope you enjoy Find.me as much as we did!
